  "message": "Hey everyone, my mother helps with a committee at my sisters high school and they need some volunteers for an event this Saturday! \n\nIt is at the Depot. Downtown indoors. You would be Serving food, beer, taking tickets, checking ideas, etc. \n\nIf anyone could help out that would be greatly appreciated and please message me!\n\n**Disclaimer I think it is a Badger Tailgate event, so that might be a deterrent for some of you. Also, because there is alcohol you have to be 21+.",
