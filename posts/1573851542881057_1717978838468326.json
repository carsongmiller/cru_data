  "message": "Hey Guys, I hope you all are having a great Summer. There is a fantastic Christian Summer Camp called North Central Camp Cherith (http://www.camp-cherith.com/) that I attend every summer and now, I'm a counselor there. But this summer I am unable to make it. The director reached out to me today saying that the Lord has provided them with an abundance of campers within the past few days and now they are under staff. They are looking for some Godly men that want to make a difference in the lives of these children (1st-12th grade) who want to learn more about the Lord and sharing the Gospel with them. Camp starts this Saturday 6/18 and goes until Friday 6/24. This is a wonderful camp and this camp shaped me into the person who I am today. If you're interested or know anyone that is interested or just have questions please don't hesitate to contact me. My number is 763-381-1774, Thanks!",
