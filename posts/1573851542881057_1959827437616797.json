  "message": "Hey Cru! My house (Evans Scholars) is having a blood drive this Saturday from 11-4. Giving blood is an awesome way to help out people in need. Here are some facts about blood:\n\nEvery two seconds in the U.S. someone needs blood\n\nAbout 7,000 units of platelets and 10,000 units of plasma are needed daily in the U.S.\n\nA single car accident victim may need as many as 100 pints of blood, with the average transfusion being about 3 pints.\n\nThere is a huge need for blood every year, and it is the season of giving, so if you are interested in donating, please DM me or comment below so I can give you more details! Take care!",
