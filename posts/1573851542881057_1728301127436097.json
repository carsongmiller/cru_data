  "message": "Hey Everyone, earlier I mentioned that I am a counselor at North Central Camp Cherith Cherith (http://www.camp-cherith.com/) but this summer I am unable to make it. Another one of the Camp Directors reached out to me today looking for more counselors for the last week of camp this year. They are looking for some Godly men that want to make a difference in the lives of these children (1st-12th grade) who want to learn more about the Lord and sharing the Gospel with them. Camp starts Saturday 7/30 and goes until Friday 8/5. This is a wonderful camp and this camp shaped me into the person who I am today and made my Faith stronger. If you're interested or know anyone that is interested or just have questions please don't hesitate to contact me via Facebook or Phone. My number is 763-381-1774, Thanks!",
