  "message": "Hey y'all! I am still looking for a subleaser for the spring semester in the lighthouse! People are beginning to get their acceptance letters to the U for the spring, so if you hear of anyone transferring here PLEASE send them my way :) They would be sharing a room with two other women at the lighthouse and the rent would be $375, but I would be okay with lowering it to $300 if that helped them make their decision :) thanks so much!"
