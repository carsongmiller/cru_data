  "message": "Hey team! Be sure to think back about any times you've been able to have spiritual conversations/share the gospel in the past couple of weeks. The numbers that I got from texts this week and last week were pretty low, but I don't think that's because people weren't sharing the Gospel--just that people forgot to text it in--an easy thing to forget. So take a couple minutes and send those in : )",
