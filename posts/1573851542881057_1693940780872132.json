  "message": "Hi everyone!  It's April 16th, which means that the annual University of Minnesota Unlimited Dance Marathon is here!  The event is a once a year big event in efforts to fundraise for kids who suffer from serious medical conditions at the Masonic Children's Hospital.  The event is FREE from 10am to 10pm in the Sports Pavilion,  and breakfast lunch and dinner is served for dancers. You can come and go as you wish,  but I'd really encourage you to stay as long as you are able to- we as college students are able to create such a big impact on the kids, who see us standing alongside them against their illness. I'd like to see you there if you are able to,  Dance Marathon is a great and not to mention fun way to make a difference.  Please message me in any way of you have questions! \n\ud83d\udc22",
