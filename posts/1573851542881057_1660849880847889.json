With that being so soon, I have some important info for everyone attending that was included in this week's email but here it is again in case you missed it:\n\nYou can still purchase tickets!! We want everyone to invite a roommate and/or a friend!! Let's make this a huge group! \nCost: $23. Use this link to purchase your ticket: www.timberwolves.com/groupoffers\nUse promo code: CRU\n \nWhen and Where: Meet at the East Bank light rail station at 4:50pm. We will be getting on the train and leaving at 5pm sharp! \nRemember: the train leaves at 5:00 and people need to purchase tickets for the light rail before hand.
