  "message": "Hey guys! I am looking for a male sublease for my apartment in 1301 for the summer. I am willing to help lower the cost of rent from 550 to 450! Also you would be living with 3 Christian men who are a blast to live with! The apartment is in great shape and there are parking spots available too! Let me know if you are interested or if you know of anyone who is! Thanks!!"
