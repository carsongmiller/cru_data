  "message": "Hi everyone! Knowing that you all are super awesome supporting people, I wanted to post some info about a Habitat for Humanity fundraiser below. You literally just have to eat chicken at Cane's before SHIFT on Wednesday to support it, so grab some friends and go :)! Thanks!\n\nThis Wednesday, Habitat for Humanity will be hosting a restaurant fundraiser from 6-8pm at Raising Cane's chicken in Stadium Village. If you have dinner at Raising Cane's during this time and say that you are there for the Habitat for Humanity fundraiser, 15% of your purchase goes directly to Habitat for Humanity. HOW COOL IS THAT!! \n\nSo for those who are usually too busy to do any community support events, this is your chance. All you have to do is eat chicken! Pretty easy. See ya Wednesday at Cane's at 6!",
