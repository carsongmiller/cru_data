  "message": "Hey guys! This past winter break I went to Israel with Passages. They are an organization that is passionate about sending Christian college students to Israel. The trip is almost entirely covered by the organization. Here is the address if you want to check out their website: http://passagesisrael.org/ \n\nMy time in Israel was absolutely incredible and I wanted other students from the U of M to have the same opportunity. I am working with the directors of the organization to send a bus from MN from December 31st - Jan 11th. If anyone is interested in hearing about my time in Israel, I am sharing about it next Thursday (4/13) at 7:30 PM at Coffman in room 305. \n\nIf you are thinking, who is this person? I don't want to hear them talk. Then you can just come to the informational meeting with two of the directors of the organization at 8:30 PM. If you come to the interest meeting, there is no obligation to go, it is just a place to ask questions!\n\nMy email is haszx008@umn.edu. Feel free to email me if you are interested in the trip or have questions or want to know how much I ended up paying (like I said its almost entirely covered)! \n\nI hope to see some of you next week! Sorry for the long post!",
