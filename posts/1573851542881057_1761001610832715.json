  "message": "well would ya look at that, it's Tuesday!\nThat means -- I am going sharing in Coffman today from 5:30-6:30 pm, we will meet at the top of the escalators.\nFor those of you who don't know what sharing entails, it's essentially having a conversation with people about their lives and relativity to faith/God. If you have never been before, you can absolutely still come and we will teach you/show you how to start a conversation about faith. (it is scary, I know) \n\nFor the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner (Paul). Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. -  2 Timothy 1:7-8",
