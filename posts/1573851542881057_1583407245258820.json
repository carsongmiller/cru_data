  "message": "For those of you sticking around the Cities this summer, \n\nLet's continue to be a community that encourages one another, points each other towards Christ, and pushes us to grow in our faith this summer!  I would love to find a night for weekly worship and prayer with you all outside under the stars.  Possibly Wednesday nights, after the volleyball matches that will be going down.  Let me know if you're interested.  We'll keep you posted...   \n\nFor those of you involved in the group last summer, \"Summer Shenanigans\" turned out to be a hit.  We thought we should bring it back. It's a new summer, time for new shenanigans.  In this updated version of \"Summer Shenanigans 2.0,\" please feel free to post any pickup sporting games, impromptu worship nights, funtivities, and any events around the Cities that you think would be fun to get a group together to go to.  Please invite anyone that will be around this summer! \n\nPeace",
