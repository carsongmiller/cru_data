  "message": "Hi everyone!  Have you ever dreamed of being on stage at Cru Winter Conference?  Well, dream no more, I have an opportunity for you! I'm organizing a drama and I need about 10 people total, some men and some women.  It doesn't require any talking or memorizing, just movement.  I'd like to have one rehearsal before break and we'll have a couple at the conference (you'll perform during the morning main session on the 29th).  The drama is about how we can enjoy and interact with the Holy Spirit during the day and you'll be interacting with one central main actress/dancer that is already cast.  If you're interested comment below and add me as a friend so we can talk details!",
