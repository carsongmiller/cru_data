  "message": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am looking for someone to sublease my spot in the Treehouse (715 13th Ave SE) this summer! You would be sharing a room with Lauren Otto when she is not in Paris and doing other fun things :) Rent is $330 per month plus about $7 for internet and about $10 for electricity. Let me know if you are or if you know anyone who might be interested, I'm really trying to get this spot filled!! Thanks!",
