  "message": "Good morning everyone! I'll be going out sharing today in Coffman from 4:30 to 5:30 and would love to have you join me!\n\nWith only two weeks of sharing left, the Go Be The Voice team would love to challenge and encourage you to join us this week, next week, or both(!) before the semester is over. As followers of Christ, we have been given the boldness and confidence of the Lord to go out and spread God's light across this campus--our Heavenly Father delights in seeing His children being His hands and feet here in this world! \n\nNewcomers or repeats, we would LOVE to see you! Enjoy the rest of your week!",
