  "message": "Hi everyone! For those of you who don't know me, I am one of the 14 guys who lives in the Baby Blue. I am looking for a subleaser from June 1st through August 31st. The rent is $469 for all of the amenities. But if you are a picky eater and want to spend your cash on healthier choices then the rent is $389. Message me if you are interested or know of anyone who needs a cheap place to stay for the summer.",
