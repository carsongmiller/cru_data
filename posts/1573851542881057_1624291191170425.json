  "message": "Hi everyone! So, sky zone was super fun last night. I was thinking just checking if anyone would be interested in possibly making a group that goes to sky zone once every 2 weeks. A good time to go would be either Thursdays between 4pm to 6pm because its half off, or on Saturday nights from 8pm to 11pm because its $15 dollars for 3 hours, and also on Saturday evenings its ages 15+. Inbox me on Facebook or text me at 507-430-1236 if your interested!",
