  "message": "SVC Work day tomorrow, 9am-12pm. Let's help them clean and fix up the church, and do some outside yard work. \n\nStadium Village Church is having a work day from 9am-12pm tomorrow, Saturday, Nov 5th, followed by a chili lunch (The Gopher game is at 2:30, so you won't miss it). \n\nPastor Lowell has asked if some Cru students could help. I know there's been quite a bit going on this week with Justice Week, but I think it would be awesome to have a bunch of us serve the church by helping with the work day. They are a great ministry to the U of M campus, and a great blessing to Cru for letting us use their facility for Shift. Let's give back and bless them with TONS of help this Saturday. \n\nPlease consider serving for all or part of the time. \nComment on here, or email me if you can help. (Ryan.carlson@cru.org)",
