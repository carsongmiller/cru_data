  "message": "Hello everyone, Nathan Studanski and I are seeing if anyone is interested in going to sky zone tonight. I believe it's ages 15+ after 8pm and it stays open until 11 pm. I believes rates for jumping times are $9, $13, and $17 dollars for half hour, an hour, and an hour and half respectively, plus a $2 dollar fee for sky socks. Quite honestly, you probably wouldn't need to jump any longer than an hour because it is a pretty strenuous activity, but super fun! I have car that fits 5 including myself, and so far I have 3 spots left. If that closes up unfortunately you will have to find your own way, but I really hope that you'll join me, it's going to be a lot of fun! If you interested just text me at 507-430-1236.",
