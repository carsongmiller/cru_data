  "message": "Hey guys!! Sorry for all of the Big Break announcements, but there is lots to be done because WE LEAVE IN 10 DAYS!!!!!! (woot woot!)\n\nWith that being said, we have sweet news! UW-Stout is offering to drive down any students that still want to come to Big Break who were not able to get on the UofM bus! If this is you, please message me ASAP and let me know if you'd like to come!\n\nYou would still be placed in a room with UofM students. The only thing that would change is how you are getting to PCB!\n\nThe temp in PCB is currently in the 70's and sunny :)",
