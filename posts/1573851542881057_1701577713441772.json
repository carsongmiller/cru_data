  "message": "If anyone is looking for a part-time summer job, I have great news!  I am not going to be in town this summer and have to leave the family I PCA (Personal Care Assistant) for.  I got to work with an incredible 12-yr old boy with autism a couple nights a week and it was super fun.  You would need a car to drive him to various activities such as therapy, Tae Kwon Do, and trampolining at SkyZone.  If you are interested at all or have any questions, please message me!",
