  "message": "Calling all women in need of housing next year!\nAs many of you know there is \"gospel houses\" among the women of Cru and other ministries on campus. I live in the Lighthouse, known for its sheer number capacity of 18 women in one house. (And it's great) \nThis year we have many Seniors graduating and leaving us (tears) So, the house is losing many of its members and we are being faced with a scary thought that the house may not make it to next year. \nI am one of the few that would like to see the Lighthouse continue to foster Christian community among women and I'm one of the few not graduating!\n\nIf you are looking for (very affordable) housing next year, contact me on Facebook or text me @ 3203396673 \nWe have lots of room!! \n(Ps if you don't want to live here but are in support, may you please pray for the house? Thank you!)\n\nYou can also contact me on facebook or text me at 763-234-5586!! WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU. \n\nThis has also been posted in the cru women page",
