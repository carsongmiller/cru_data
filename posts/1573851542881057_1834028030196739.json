  "message": "Men!  Dudes and Doughnuts!  It's happening this Saturday at 10 am, and if you have no idea what this is, comment here and we'll get you added to the event, but just to sate your appetite for more information until you see the event, here's a taste: We're getting together this Saturday morning, just the dudes, and spending some quality time together as Men.  We'll be getting off campus, getting outside, eating doughnuts, and spending time with the Lord TOGETHER.  It's gonna be AWESOME.\n\nIf you're a guy and can drive, also reach out to me and let me know, because we'll need some drivers to get us where we're going (it won't be a long drive, staying in the cities).\n\nI will see YOU men on Saturday",
