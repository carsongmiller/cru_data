  "message": "Suh dudes---\n\nSo as some of you know, campus elections (Student Body President and Vice President) are coming up on April 6th-8th at vote.umn.edu. I know this is a weird way of putting it, but we can really be stewards of our vote. Only about 20% of students end up voting, so your vote could really REALLY make a difference. \n\nThere's a debate between the two people running for President on this Thursday (the 31st) from 6-8pm in MCB 3-120. They'll be debating on topics such as diversity, mental health, social justice, etc. (aka things we should all care about as Christians/as regular people lol). \n\nSo long story short- come to the debate on Thursday to get informed on how we can best love and serve this campus through its leaders. If you want to meet somewhere beforehand to have a lil cru crew to walk in with, hit me up. If you want a ride to MCB bc you live far away, also hit me up, as I would be happy to drive you.\n\nIf you don't want to come for the debate, come to get updated on what our campus will be looking like in the next year.\nIf you don't want to come for the campus update, come to listen and pray for our school.\nIf you don't want to come to listen and pray, come for the free Qdoba.\n\nThat's right, free Qdoba starting at 5:30. See y'all there.",
