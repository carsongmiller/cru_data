  "message": "Good morning, everyone! \n\nIf any of you know a female who needs housing spring semester or in the summer, please let me know. I'm not 100% sure about transferring, but I want to start looking for a subleaser since they're so hard to find. I live at the lighthouse and share a room with Katelyn and Ella. Rent is $415! \n\nLet me know if you can think of anyone; I'm willing to pay for part of their rent so it's cheaper for them, leave my stuff here for them so they don't have to buy any furniture, etc. \n\nThanks and have a good day!"
