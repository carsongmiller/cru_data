  "message": "Hello everyone!! \nAs some of you know I will be going to Alaska for Cru Summer Missions, and there will be a group of 10+ people driving to Juneau. Around the 15th-17th of May, The exact day will be figured out a bit later, a group of about 10 or so will be stopping in Minneapolis for the night. Would those of you living in Gospel housing be willing to open up your floor space/couches for a night before we continue on our journey? I will gladly repay your generosity in food and love!",
