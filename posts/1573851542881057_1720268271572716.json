  "message": "**Fall Job Posting/Opening**\nHEY ALL!  If anyone is looking for a job this upcoming fall, I will be leaving the family I PCA for to start my MT internship (woohoo!)  Anyways the family has trusted me to find a replacement and so I thought to post on this page of wonderful people.  You would be taking care of a young boy who has autism & ADHD, but I say taking care very lightly, he is high functioning and you're basically just hanging out with a really cool kid who loves math, piano, and has perfect pitch (casual).  Hours are flexible, I worked 3 days a week during the school year, but there is room for more.  It pays well & is recommended if you have your own vehicle!  PLEASE PLEASE message me if you are at all interested, or would like more details!!  Keep enjoying the summer please~!",
