Wifi and electric together cost about $35/month, laundry room is in basement of building. Fully furnished (unless you want to share the room, then one person would need to bring a bed).\n\nGreat community living here, there are 4 CRU apartment units at this location, so always someone who loves Jesus and can hang out right next door! \n\nMessage if interested. :)",
