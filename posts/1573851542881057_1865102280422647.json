  "message": "Hi friends!!\n\nMy friend Theresa, who works for Midwest Dairy, is helping coordinate Midwest Dairy's annual princess event and is looking for one or two people (no gender preference) to lead a nondenominational worship service for ~20-30 people on Saturday, May 20 at St. Ben's in St. Cloud. The service would be 30-60 minutes and begin around 5 p.m. Typically, they have only had Catholic mass, but they want to provide an option to the girls who are not Catholic.\n\nThe person or persons would give a few readings, lead prayer and share a message. Theresa also said they could provide some video sound from YouTube if you have sound ideas.\n\nI am not able to do it, but I would love to see someone provide this opportunity for the girls and preach the gospel message.\n\nMessage me if you're interested ASAP!! Thanks all!",
