  "message": "SENIORS: Hey y'all! As some of you know, I'm currently involved in a TV reporting class and will be doing my final story of the year on Cru/Shift. I'm hoping to talk to a couple of you about your experience in Cru and what it's like being in a \"religious affiliated\" group on campus for a majority of your college experience. SOOO, if you're willing to be interviewed on camera this Wednesday before or after Shift, please let me know in the comments or in a personal message.\n\nAlso, there are about 20 students in my class who will watch this and, based on conversations, none of them are believers. This is a super cool opportunity to talk about Cru, the love of Christ, and why He is worthy of our praise and worship during college. Like I said, let me know in the comments or message me if you're interested.\n\nThanks guys!\n\nP.S. This means I'll be filming parts of Shift on Wednesday. So, don't freak out if there's a camera in front of you!",
