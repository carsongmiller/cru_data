  "message": "We crave significance.  We want our lives to matter.  We want to positively impact this world and bring change.  We all intellectually know that involves growing in our leadership and influence, but we can struggle to know what that looks like or how to go about doing that. Tonight from 7pm-8pm, Hope on Campus will meet in STSS (Bruininks Hall 330), where Pastor Cor will be sharing about what makes a leader, what doesn\u2019t, leadership misconceptions, and how to grow in your leadership potential. Cor has been a pastor at Hope for many years and is the Director of the Leadership Development Institute for the past 7 years, which has helped raise up hundreds of leaders.  So, whether you sense God\u2019s leading to be a lawyer, a teacher, a pastor, an accountant, engineer, nurse, doctor, or whatever options are before you, you won\u2019t want to miss this opportunity to learn how to grow in your leadership potential! \n\n7pm-8pm. STSS 330. Hope on Campus. Oh, and Cor and I are leading a group to Applebee's afterwards! See you there!",
