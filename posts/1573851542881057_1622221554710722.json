  "message": "Hey Everyone This Wednesday there is a pro-life rally in St Paul from 4-6 pm. We were asked by local congresswomen to have 4 volunteers be willing to come at 3pm and help out with parking and other jobs around the rally. I am planning on attending and would be willing to give rides back to campus. If you are interested please contact me as soon as you can.\n\n-Mike",
