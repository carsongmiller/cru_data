  "message": "Hello UMN:)  Hope you are all enjoying your summer adventures.\n\nOne of our goals as a region is to continue to improve our student resources on sexual wholeness. Can you imagine every students getting to have someone be real and open with them about the area of sexual purity during their first semester in school? What a difference it might make in their college years and beyond.\n\nSpecifically I've been part of working on a 6th Life Concept call \"From Sexual Brokenness to Sexual Wholeness\". It's hot off the presses and in need of some real life feedback. Thus my question to you...\n\nAre any of you discipling someone this summer that you could go through this Life Concept with and give us feedback? It would take under 90 min and doesn't require any prep. I would say the audience could be HS or College. We are looking for it to be completed and have feedback given by Aug 1.\n\nIf you are willing, would you comment here or shoot me an email? londa.wagneratcru.org. Thanks everyone and would love your prayers for this to help students experience wholeness.",
