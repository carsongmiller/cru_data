  "message": "Hey guys!  I have a job opportunity for anyone interested in making a little extra cash!  Every Monday from 8-2 a family who lives in South Minneapolis would love a babysitter.  They live about 10 minutes from campus if there is traffic so it's pretty convenient!    They have three little boys who love walks, playing at the park, and riding the scooter.  The last hour and a half they all take naps so it's pretty easy.  Please message me personally if you are interested and/or have questions!"
