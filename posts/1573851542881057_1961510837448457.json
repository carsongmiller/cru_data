  "message": "The Lord gave me this message:\n\n\"I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.\"\n\n\"O Sovereign Lord,\" I said, \"I can't speak for you! I'm too young!\"\n\nThe Lord replied, \"Don't say 'I'm too young,' for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you. I, the Lord, have spoken!\" Then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth and said,\n\n\"Look, I have put my words in your mouth! Today I appoint you to stand up against nations and kingdoms. Some you must destroy and tear down, destroy and overthrow. Others you must build up and plant.\" (Jeremiah 1:4-10)\n\nOk, so this may not be in the same context as Christ's commission, but it is clear that God can call us to work for him no matter how prepared we think we are to serve him. You do not have to have a doctorate in theology to share your faith. Trust me, I myself still have much to learn. \n\nBelieve it or not, we also have God's presence in the form of the Holy Spirit within us, which is something that even Jeremiah did not have when he prophesied in God's name.\n\nIf you are curious about what this looks like in action, I implore you to join us sharing our faith with others at Coffman. We will meet at the top of the escalators in the lobby at 3:30. Soli Deo Gloria.",
