  "message": "Hey SENIORS! For anyone soon to be graduating and wanting to work in a fun office community with great coworkers, this support staff position is opening up in May! You would be mainly processing client paperwork & other office tasks within a foster care/case management non-profit! It's the best staff I have ever worked with, and I learned a lot about social work here here. Great intro job if you are looking for a non-hectic transition out of college in the social services realm. :)\n\n",
