  "message": "Hey all- are you or any ladies you know looking for housing? If so, the house I live in is looking for a lovely female roommate to join the crew! Rent is $437 a month including all utilities and there's an option to jump in on community groceries for $55 a month which can save a good chunk of $$ (versus going solo). We're also right in Dinkytown, so close to the U and all that good stuff.\n\nYou'd be living with six other amazing women who love God and across the street from some guys who are equally awesome. The house is pretty enormous, so although there's seven women there's enough space to spread out and be alone for you introverts out there-- as a fellow 'I' I can vouch for that!\n\nIf you're interested feel free to message me and we can talk details.\nThanks guys!",
