  "message": "Hello Ladies! So my friend Alyssa Burk and I are looking for two more girls to live with us in a two bedroom, two bath apartment at the Venue next year. Rent would be around $600 a month and the building has two work out areas, two lounge rooms, and a study room, with free printing and computers. This gives plenty of space to get work done, stay healthy, and be close to campus. We are both freshman, pretty chill, and like to have fun, but we also stay on top of school work. We also love cats, Gilmore Girls, and Jesus, so if you wanted to get to know us more or be our roommate, feel free to message one of us!\nMy cell: 651-491-2107",
