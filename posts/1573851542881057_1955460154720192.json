  "message": "Ladies! I am looking to sublease for the summer (June throughAugust) at the Fourth Street Co-op in Dinky. Rent is $405 a month and I also have an underground parking spot for an extra $100 a month if you want it, totaling $505. It is a shared room so you'd most likely be with another subleaser, or if you have a friend looking too, they can sublease from my roommate Laura Gove (also $405 per month). If you'd like to make it your own room it would be $810 per month without parking and $910 with parking. Please let me know if you or anyone else that you know would be interested!!!",
