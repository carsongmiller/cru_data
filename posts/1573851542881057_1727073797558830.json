  "message": "Hello Everyone!\n\nOver these past couple days, our country, community, others communities, families, friends, and many others have been hurt, angry, and full of heavy hearts. I know for myself, I have been constantly processing what is happening. Many have been brought to tears by the way many are responding, the hurt many are feeling, and the brokenness our country is experiencing. \n\nBut let\u2019s all stop and ask ourselves how God wants us to respond. In Acts 12, Peter was captured and put in prison by King Herod, shortly after the king had killed James. How did the Church respond? They gathered together. And what did they do after they gathered together? They prayed and continued to pray until Peter showed up at their door. \n\nRight now God is calling us. He is teaching us how to solve impossible problems. It\u2019s very simple: we must pray. God moves in a direct response to prayer, so that is what we must do now.\n\nI\u2019m inviting you all to come together as a church and pray. Come to the mall tomorrow morning to join together as one and pray for our country, the black community, the police community, the loved ones affected, and any others who are feeling hurt and broken. Invite others to pray as well. \n\nHope to see you tomorrow morning at 11am in the mall (at the U of M).\n\n\u2026\u2026\n\nI also encourage you to gather and pray, even if you are unable to come together on campus tomorrow morning. Find others and pray.",
