A good friend of mine Jennifer Johnson who's apart of Chi Alpha with me is studying through the National Student Exchange program in the spring, and she is looking for someone to take over her apartment lease January 2017 through August 2017. The apartment is at a very reasonable price in the Sydney Hall Apartments with a shared 2 bed 2 bath unit. You would be living with 3 other sophomore girls. Message her if this sparks any interest and feel free to ask her any questions regarding the living situation."
