  "message": "If anyone's looking for a historical perspectives lib-ed or thinks a religious studies minor would be cool (cuz it is) or needs a fun class, you should look into RELS 1082 Jesus in History. It covers the four gospels, other writings like Gospel of Judas, and watches movies like Jesus Christ Superstar and Matrix to figure out how they represent Jesus. Professor for it is really cool and they need more students to register so they can have more TAs and have a reason to pay grad students. If you're doing the minor, you can also email prof to set up independent study with an extra paper or two for 3xxx credit. Link for it is here\n\n",
