  "message": "Hey team! :D Do you deal with depression, anxiety, or any other type of mental wellness issue? Well I sure do, and many other Crutons do too! Come to my house Saturday at 11:30am and I'll make you waffles! :D\n\nIn addition to waffles, these weekly get-togethers I host for those of us dealing with mental wellness struggles exists for the express purpose of talking about our feelings and experiences, and getting support from others who are going through the same types of things. I was very skeptical about this type of thing before I started being a part of it, but it's seriously SO life-giving! Don't struggle with this kind of stuff alone!\n\nIf you would be at all interested in being a part of this type of thing either this weekend or in the future, message me like 'hey I'm interested maybe'. If you think somebody you know might be interested, message me their name :) They don't have to be a Cruton, or even completely sold on this whole Jesus-thing (just most of us are, and that's a big part of us overcoming stuff.)\n\nPros: I have a kitten who loves meeting new people. Also, waffles.\nCons: Getting out of bed/leaving my house is hard and people/new experiences are scary. (All very valid. If you think any of those things might hinder you, message me anyway!)",
