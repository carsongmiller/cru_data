  "message": "Hi Friends. Have any of you already taken physiology 3051 and still have your CT book? I lost mine and was hoping to study from it this weekend when I went home. Would anyone be willing to let me borrow theirs sometime before I leave in the afternoon? We have to turn one in in the morning which is unfortunate because not all of the keys that were posted have the questions, so I couldn\u2019t do the CTs on scratch paper!",
