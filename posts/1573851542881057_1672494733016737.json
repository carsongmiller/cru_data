  "message": "Hello! My friend (Emily Wangen) and I are looking for two girls to share an apartment with us starting next fall! We have recently just signed with 412 lofts, which is right outside of Dinkytown, in a two bedroom, two bath apartment. You would be sharing a bedroom and it would be around $600 plus utilities, but the price is negotiable (they have a huge sale going on if you sign). If you are interested in getting to know more about us, then go ahead and message us or comment! We would love to chat with you so that we can have an awesome year next year!"
