  "message": "Hello my fellow brothers and sisters! There is this awesome annual conference coming next weekend called \"Legacy\" that Cru is putting on for students who come from various and ethnic backgrounds from the Midwest. I highly encourage you all to check it out, or talk to your friends about going. This is one of my favorite conferences that Cru puts on and I would love it if you guys could experience it with me and few others from the Twin Cities campus. Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this astonishing opportunity. If you guys have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.",
