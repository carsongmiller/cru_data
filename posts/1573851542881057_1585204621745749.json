  "message": "Hey everyone! With summer on it's way and Cru wrapped up for the semester, one of the things I'm starting this summer (starting NEXT week) is a co-ed Bible study. It'll be more like a larger group meeting with worship, support, prayer, Bible study elements, and just overall a mid-week relief and place for you to come and join other believers who are in Minneapolis over the summer! Whether you're graduated or were just a freshman this past year, you are invited. You are VERY much welcome to join us. It's open to anyone who is or is not in Cru. We're just trying to create a restful, uplifting, intentional group to love God and encourage one another. Through this, hopefully we can grow closer to one another by the end of the summer and create deeper fellowship. \n\nIf you are interested in being apart of this, I'll post more information in the coming days. Right now we are looking at possibly Wednesday or Thursday nights at 8:00pm. Location will be determined sooner than later. If you have any questions, feel free to message me on the ole BookFace or send me a text! More info to come!",
