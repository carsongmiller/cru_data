  "message": "(Shameless summer missions plug) Still plenty of time to explore, pray about, or sign up for any of the various summer missions! http://www.cru.org/opportunities/mission-trips/summer.html . We've got 4 in our region for stateside- North Myrtle Beach, Jersey Shore, Badlands, and Milwaukee, as well as Paris, Australia, Tanzania, 4J, and a few other international ones. \n\nWe had 17 Gophers in NMB last summer, I can honestly say it's the best summer I could have hoped for. You get ministry experience on the beach and at your workplace, but also 10 weeks of very tight community with 80 other college students who become your family for the rest of college and hopefully life after college. We had goals of 10 people to NMB and Paris last year, would be cool to hit them both this year since there's I think 3 or 4 to each already. Any age in school can go, we had people as old as 27 go as students, but especially for freshmen or sophomores if you're not ready for an internship in your field it is an incredible way to spend your summer.\n\nIf anyone's got any more questions about summer missions I'd love to answer them, and myself or one of the other Gophers who've gone before could meet up for lunch and discuss the summer with you. \n\nP.S.- SKOL VIKINGS",
