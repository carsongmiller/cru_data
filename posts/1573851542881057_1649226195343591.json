  "message": "Today is the last day to sign up for TCX.\n\nThis conference could very well be the highlight of your break!\n\nI don't say that just to say it, but it was the highlight after my freshman fall semester when I was having a great time with God, and gained a ton of knowledge on missions and friends in CRU as a weird, awkward freshman.\n\nAfter a really terrible sophomore fall semester, TCX really broke me and brought me back to God and spurred what was one of the greatest periods of growth with God in my life the following months.\n\nTCX is dope, bomb diggity, and every other positive adjective in between.\n\nhttp://gotcx.com/register/\n\nEmail Brad: brad.gustafson@cru.org if you need to contact him about financial needs. Finances are not an issue: we will make sure you go to TCX.",
