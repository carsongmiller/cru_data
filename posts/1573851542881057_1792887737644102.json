  "message": "Hey guys!\nIf any of you are looking for something to do tonight, my friends and I have put together a charity fundraiser concert at the Art House North in Saint Paul! There's a variety show at 4:30 and then Early Eyes and The Happy Children will be performing later on. Tickets will be $6 at the door, and all the money raised is going straight to the Malala fund to support education for girls around the world. Hope to see some of you there! :)",
