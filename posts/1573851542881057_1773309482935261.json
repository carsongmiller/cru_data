  "message": "Hello friends! If anyone in here likes the band Remedy Drive, they're putting on a concert at my home church! It's in a little less than 2 weeks, on Friday, November 4th, at 7 PM. For those of you that don't know them, they're a great Christian rock band! \n\nIts at Peace Church in Eagan, MN, its about 25 minutes away, and its super easy to get to there driving or theres even a metro bus that takes you to the Eagan Outlet mall, which is about a quarter mile away from the church. \n\nIn the photo is all the details! I hope some of you guys can make it! \n\nBelow is the link to buy tickets! They are $15 at the door, $12 Presale, or $8 Group rate of 10 or more in a group.\n\nhttps://peaceeagan.breezechms.com/form/3c2834",
