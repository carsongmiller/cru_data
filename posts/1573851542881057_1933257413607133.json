  "message": "Hello fellow CRUtons and alumni!\nIn light of a recent blog post entitled '10 Questions with a Gay Christian' and the ensuing conversations, the Spirit has prompted me to write this post.\n\nFirst, for those who don't know me, my name is Jared and I attended the U of M from 2010 to 2014. While I came to college looking for what the world had to offer, Christ found me within a matter of weeks in a CRU Bible Study. My fondest memories come from my four years in CRU. Secondly, I used to identify as a homosexual and was an active participant in that lifestyle. Since the onset of puberty I manifested sexual desires exclusively for men. I struggled with lust and pornography just as much (probably much more) than the average male. I even dated another man for a time. My purpose in telling you this is so that you recognize that all \nthat I say here comes from an intimate understanding of homosexuality and its bondage. I say all that I do with agonizing compassion for those that wrestle with this particular deviancy and also for anyone who may sympathize with it even if they do not wrestle with it personally.\n\nI realize that the author of said blog post asked for all comments and questions to be directed to her privately, but when something of this magnitude is posted for such a wide audience to see, it requires a public response. Intentionally or not, when you post something on Facebook you are promoting something or teaching something. The purpose of the blog was rather vague; I do not believe it ever explicitly advocated for the affirming of homosexual relationships but the lack of clear warning against them was enough to prompt this post.\n \nIn this case, what was subtly being taught is that 'gay' and 'Christian' can exist together. Friends, in the interest of being \nbrief, this is a false teaching. This is a really, really serious deal. This isn't a choice to be made; there is no \"affirming\" or \"non-affirming,\" there is no \"liberal\" Christianity and \"conservative\" Christianity - there is Christianity and not-Christianity, which includes all things that look very much like Christianity but are not. Paul very explicitly in many places states that the sexually immoral will not inherit the kingdom of God. And not only those who practice it, but those who approve it as well. The very Word of Yahweh has declared those who actively practice homosexuality are sexually immoral, not only in specific verses and passages (see 1 Cor 6:9, 1 Tim 1:10, Lev 18:22, 20:13, Gen 19, Rom 1) but in the macro-view of God's design for human life (see all relationships portrayed in the Bible and how humans procreate). What would Paul say about a Thieving Christian? What about a Murdering Christian? A sin identity is incompatible with the new birth. But again, I do know what it is like to be trapped in an identity. I myself once bought into the lies that I could not change. But by God's grace I really, truly did change. To be clear, the only conversion therapy I condone is just that-conversion. Salvation from sin by the grace given us in Christ Jesus the Son of God. \n\nSo very joyfully, the Word of God does not leave anyone without hope. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him. I testify to you that Christ Jesus has come to set people free - not free from problems, not free from low self-esteem, but free from sin! In February of 2015, the Holy Spirit revealed Christ Jesus to me through His Word in Ephesians in such a way that my sins were mortified at the root-I truly am no longer a slave to the lust or envy that I loved. Augustine said it this way: \"To Your grace I attribute it, and to Your mercy, that You have melted away my sin as it were ice.\" And Charles Wesley put it so famously in his hymn: \"Thine eye diffused a quickening ray\u2014I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;My chains fell off, my heart was free, I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.\"\n\nFriends, do you know this grace? Has Christ appeared so gloriously to you that you now hate the sin you once loved? I urge you, please ask God whether you do or not. Search His Word and ask for His Spirit to show you Jesus Christ!\n\nThis is not a personal attack on anyone. I do not write this to the author or to the participants in the blog, but to the \nspiritual community of CRU as a whole. Questions, comments, angry rants-all welcome. I know very well that this post was not perfect but I am not ashamed of the Gospel because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes!",
