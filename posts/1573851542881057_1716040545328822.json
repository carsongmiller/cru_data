  "message": "Hey Everyone!\n\nDo you want to go to the TOGETHER 2016 event on July 16 at the National Mall, but you don't know how to get there? Good news! We have a way for you to get there! \n\nWe are joining Cru and others from Fargo Metro area on their buses to worship God with many other brothers and sisters in Christ at the National Mall.\n\nThe deadline to sign up to ride with them is June 15th (that's one week!). The cost is about $230, including hotel and bus fares (not including food). We will be picked up in Minneapolis on Thursday and arrive back home in Minneapolis late on Sunday. We will be staying at the Hyatt Regency.\n\nTo sign up, follow this link: https://www.eventregistrationtool.com/#/register/e05fca77-dbe3-49a2-9625-bf04bf2a1cc6/page/\n\nAnd for more details, check out the facebook event: https://www.facebook.com/events/1027429037345664/",
