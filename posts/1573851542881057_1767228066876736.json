  "message": "Good Morning Cru fam!\nToday I am leading a sharing time from 5:30-6:30 in Coffman (meet at top of escalators)\nPlease consider taking an hour out of your day to invest in the life of another (or two  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af )\nThat hour of your time has an enteral value that CANNOT compare to anything else. One conversation can have the power of changing a heart to experience Christ for the very first time. \nIf you've never been before, as always, I'd love to let you come with me or someone else who has had experience doing this.\nHave a rockin' and rad Tuesday y'all\nPeace n' blessings \u270c\ud83c\udffc\ufe0f",
