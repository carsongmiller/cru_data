However, this post is to ask if anyone is willing and able to help with tasks such as:\n-setting up\n-making pancakes\n-pouring drinks\n-transporting food to the designated location (possibly need a car)\n-cleaning up\nIf you are interested please message me. Thank you and I hope you are all having a great week! :)",
